# Example Outputs

This folder contains sample outputs from the mesh processing pipeline to demonstrate what the tool produces.

## Contents

- `sample_outputs/` - Complete example output from a pipeline run
  - `images/` - Visualization plots
  - `meshes/` - Processed mesh files
  - `metrics.json` - Computed metrics
  - `REPORT.md` - Auto-generated report

## Purpose

These examples are included in the repository to:
- Show what outputs look like
- Provide reference for users
- Demonstrate the pipeline capabilities

## Note

The `outputs/` folder in the root directory is excluded from Git (via `.gitignore`) as it contains generated files. This `examples/` folder contains a curated sample that IS tracked in Git for documentation purposes.
